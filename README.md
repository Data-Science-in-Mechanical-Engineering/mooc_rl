# MOOC Reinforcement Learning Code Base

Welcome to the code base for the MOOC on Reinforcement Learning! Below is an overview of the repository structure, instructions for setting up the environment locally, the binder link, and how to access and use the code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders by weeks. We provide notebooks for Week 3, Week 5, Week 7, and Week 8.

## Setting up the Environment

### Setting Up the Environment Locally

To run the code and notebooks on your local machine, you'll need to set up a Python environment that includes all the required dependencies. This repository includes an `environment.yml` file that specifies the necessary packages. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reinforcement-learning-mooc.git
    cd reinforcement-learning-mooc
    ```
2. **Create a new conda environment:**:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
3. **Activate the environment:**:

    ```bash
    conda activate rl-mooc
    ```
4. **Launch Jupyter Lab:**:

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```


### Running the Code on Binder

If you prefer not to install the environment locally, you can easily run the notebooks in a cloud environment using Binder. Simply click the link below to launch the repository in Binder:


This will open the repository in an interactive Jupyter Notebook environment without needing to set up anything on your local machine.
